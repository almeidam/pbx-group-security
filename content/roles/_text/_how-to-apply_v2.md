### How to apply

We use Workable to track all our applicants, so your first step is to use the 'Apply here' link at the top of this page

In order to provide a fair and objective recruitment process, before we invite you for face-to-face interviews,
we ask you to submit a number of answers to theoretical and practical questions (questions based on from quotes taken from your CV).

Until the the 8th of June, the best way for us to meet you and for you to meet us is to
participate on the Open Security Summit (https://open-security-summit.org/).


<!--In order to provide a fair and objective recruitment process, before we invite you for face-to-face interviews, we ask you to submit your answers to theoretical and practical challenges. This helps us to identify your suitability and experience level.

Each challenge should take no longer than 10 - 15 minutes to complete, however, in order to highlight your key skills, you may take longer than the suggested time if you wish.

Please see **SOME OF THE CHALLENGES** we might ask you to do (we customise these based on your experience and CV).

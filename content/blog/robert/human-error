## Blame it on Human Error 

In his article, [Don’t Blame People for Human Error]( https://incident-prevention.com/ip-articles/don-t-blame-people-for-human-error), health and safety expert Mark Steinhofer, argues that blaming people instead of flawed processes doesn’t make anything better. His observations have application in many professions. Here is a summary for those of us who work in the field of security. 

## What Causes Human Error?

Human error is best described as an event where the decision or action of a human in a certain way negatively impacts the effectiveness of a system. 
Steinhofer classifies error into 4 types:
- Mistakes – a person is not fully aware of the correct way to perform an action 
- Mismatches – the task is beyond the ability of the person asked to perform it, possibly due to a lack of training or awareness of the correct way
- Noncompliance or violation – someone does not follow the procedure as directed, or expected to; can be active or passive
- Slips or lapses – result from forgetfulness, force of habit, fatigue, etc.

Mistakes are not always random; they can fall into recurring patterns (e.g., new system, insufficient training, this hasn’t happened for ages, seasonal temps).
It is very easy to ascribe an event to human error; however, this does not prevent the same or a similar error from happening again. The challenge is to refine the system so the mistake does not reoccur, or the number of occurrences dwindles over time. 

## It’s not you, it’s the system – take action 

Flaws in a system become evident when the system is analysed. Systems are refined by changes to the working conditions when checks are inserted or steps introduced that mitigate the effects of a potential error.  Continuous analysis of, and refinements to processes leave less to chance and reduce the margin for error.

## The Swiss Cheese Model

James Reason’s Swiss cheese model compares human systems to a stack of Swiss cheese slices. The holes represent flaws in a particular system. Not all the holes line up all the time; thus, risk is mitigated. Where there are insufficient checks, however, the flaws in each layer, if they align, will result in an incident.

For example, if HR’s GDPR training is excellent, that slice may have only a few small holes reducing the chances of a breach; however, if the Packing department is lax, that slice may be full of larger holes, thereby allowing a failure of the system.
Steinhofer argues that by identifying and eliminating the flaws (or “holes”) in a defence mechanism, each layer/slice becomes stronger and the overall potential for incidents declines.

## Where do the holes in your defence mechanism come from? 
1. Unsafe acts that people commit include
    a) Slips, lapses, fumbles, 
    b) Mistakes and 
    c) Procedural violations. 

2. Latent conditions, which arise from decisions made by: 
    a) Designers, builders, 
    b) Procedure writers, and 
    c) Top-level managers. 

3. Underlying conditions can lead to error-provoking conditions, such as: 
    a) Understaffing, 
    b) Unrealistic deadlines, 
    c) Inadequate equipment, 
    d) Inexperienced workers, and 
    e) Fatigue. 

4. They also can create long-lasting weaknesses, such as: 
a) Unworkable procedures, 
b) Design, and 
c) Construction deficiencies.

## Managing Human Error

When anyone makes assumptions, or takes action without clear knowledge, mistakes are more likely to happen.
A crucial element of effective error management is establishing a reporting culture in which workers report mishaps, incidents, 
and near-misses. Without this input, there’s no good way to uncover or identify recurring errors that may grow into incidents. 
A strong reporting culture can result in a significant reduction of incidents, along with an increase in worker satisfaction and 
productivity, because everyone knows what to do – and what to avoid.

## Incidents ultimately impact customers 

Strategic consultants McKinsey & Co., report that 70% of buying experiences are based on how customers feel they are treated – this applies as much to good customer experiences as well as how a company treats customers with problems or issues with the service.  
Research by management consultants Bain & Co., found that acquiring a new customer is 5-25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. 
Such statistics suggest how fundamental good, honest communication is to retaining existing customers, even when things do not run smoothly. 
Here are some guidelines to consider when communicating with customers:

- Stick to the facts, avoid emotions 
- Apologise to the affected customer while providing assistance and assurance 
- Show that you have taken steps to remedy the issue
- State that the process is under review and necessary changes will be made 
- Thank them for their feedback having helped you to improve the process/service
- Follow up with the affected customer once the review is complete and inform them of the changes being made, coaching provided, and your commitment to quality of product and experience
- As with any business communication, remember KISS - Keep It Strong and Simple; no one wants to find War & Peace in their in-box.

This template can be adapted for different situations and shows the customer affected that the company cares: 

Dear _First Name Last Name_,
I am very sorry you had an unpleasant experience with [BRAND XXX].
We sincerely regret [SUMMARISE INCIDENT HERE].
We investigated the incident and discovered a flaw in our process. This flaw has been addressed and
changes were made to the system. Personnel have been trained, and will be monitored in the new system; this aims to prevent incidents similar to yours from happening in the future.
It is important to us that we retain your trust and that you know you can continue to rely on [XXX].
As a thank-you for your custom and support, I have credited your account with £ __.
I would also like to thank you for having brought this matter to our attention, enabling us to address it.
Finally, if there is anything I can help you with in future, please contact me directly.
Yours sincerely,
YOUR NAME, TITLE, and CONTACT DETAILS

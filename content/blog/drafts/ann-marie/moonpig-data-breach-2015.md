## The Moonpig Data Breach of 2015

In January 2015, MoonPig was publicly shamed for not having taken the security of customer data seriously.  Headlines screamed, “3 million customers’ personal information is not secure.”  The security flaw could have enabled potential hackers to place orders, view parts of credit card details and obtain personal information from customer accounts.  MoonPig was given ample warning, and the negative publicity could easily have been avoided.

## Background
In August 2013, Paul Price, a mobile app developer, informed MoonPig that he had found a flaw in their systems.  He discovered the bug while checking the security settings of code in MoonPig’s Android and iOS applications.  When submitting requests to the website through its app, he found he could access any account information with just a customer ID.  No authentication was required.  He highlighted the risk and was assured by MoonPig that they would “get right on it’.

## Public shaming
More than a year later, on 5 January 2015, Price saw the glitch was still in place and decided to go public on his blog, Paul’s Blog, http://www.ifc0nfig.com/MoonPig-vulnerability/.  He unpicked the code line by code line, exposed the flaws in the code, and posted it.  On 6 January 2015 the story was covered by the Guardian, Daily Mirror, and Daily Mail.  The negative publicity forced MoonPig to act.
Paul Price told the Guardian; "The industry standard is usually within 90 days, I gave them 13 months. I then gave them an extra four months and still no fix. It was at this point I decided to go public with my findings".

He posted a timeline of contact with MoonPig:

18 August 2013 - Initial contact made with MoonPig; “after a few emails back and forth, their reasoning was legacy code and they’ll “get right on it.”
26 September 2014 - Follow up email; issue still not resolved.  MoonPig reset the deadline to fix the glitch “before Christmas.”
5 January 2015 - Vulnerability still exists.  Despite ample time given to MoonPig to fix the issues.

The Guardian went on to report that Price had found a security gap at MoonPig’s main competition, Funky Pigeon.

Surprisingly, the MoonPig flaw is not the first hole Price has found in a British greetings-card website.  In October 2013, he disclosed a vulnerability in Funky Pigeon’s website which let an attacker take over a user’s account and gain access to personal data.  That flaw was fixed within a week.

By highlighting that Funky Pigeon had resolved the issue within one week, the Guardian more than rubbed salt in MoonPig’s wound.

## MoonPig's response
MoonPig posted a statement on its website, saying;
"We are aware of the claims made this morning regarding the security of customer data within our Apps.  We can assure our customers that all password and payment information is and has always been safe.  The security of your shopping experience at MoonPig is extremely important to us and we are investigating the detail behind today’s report as a priority.  As a precaution, our Apps will be unavailable for a time whilst we conduct these investigations and we will work to resume a normal service as soon as possible.  The desktop and mobile websites are unaffected."

## Keyboard warriors and news get to work
Fuelled by the news of a scandal, techies and reporters started digging.  It was reported that MoonPig was actively recruiting for an IT Security Officer and that the vacancy was removed on the day the news broke, creating more negative publicity.  Former employees started revealing their experiences with MoonPig and security.

A former employee, “Pud,” said;
"I worked for PhotoBox from 2003 to 2005, <!---a---> great company actually.  However, one project was to outsource the greeting card production to MoonPig.  It was a disaster. Thousands of cards had to be thrown in the bin.  From that day on, the office joke on software projects was not to be "another MoonPig."  For a few years early on, passwords in the admin screen were stored in clear text too. Support staff would often try them against the user's email provider, like Hotmail. Often, they worked. <---! please clarify---> The[y] did start hashing them as the company grew.

In an interview with the Daily Mirror, David Emm, Principal Security Researcher at internet security consultancy Kaspersky Lab, said;"
As we understand it, the reported vulnerability has not so far been used to steal personal information of MoonPig customers.  However, it seems that the vulnerability, if confirmed, would allow an attacker to access the account details of other customers.  It's important that companies take information about a vulnerability in their products very seriously.  If this vulnerability is confirmed, and it's true that MoonPig has previously failed to take any action to protect their customers for almost a year-and-a-half, this is alarming - especially for a provider of an online shopping application used to transmit highly sensitive data."

## Statement from the ICO

A few days after the news broke, the UK data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said it was; "Looking into" an alleged data security breach at personalised greetings card printer MoonPig.”
The ICO, which has the power to fine companies up to £500,000 for serious breaches of the UK Data Protection Act, tweeted, “We are aware of the incident at MoonPig and are looking into the details.”

## In the news again

On Friday, 24 July 2015, MoonPig became aware of a security issue where a number of customer email addresses, account balances and passwords had been illegally published.  As a precaution, they closed the MoonPig site and apps to investigate and contain this issue.  Following these investigations, MoonPig discovered that the compromised customer email addresses and passwords had been taken previously from other third-party websites, not directly from MoonPig.com. MoonPig contacted impacted customers advising them their passwords had been disabled to prevent any further access from the third party and advised these customers to reset their passwords the next time they logged in to the MoonPig.com site, as well as other sites and services, particularly if they used the same combination.

The communication concluded;
"If you haven’t heard from us, but are still concerned, then we recommend you reset the passwords you use for MoonPig and for other sites.  Please note, our Customer Service team cannot access your password – it is personal to you. We have now completed our final security checks and investigations and have taken the decision to reopen our website and apps.  We take our customer security very seriously and are very sorry for the concern or inconvenience this may have caused.  Our team continues to work hard to put further processes in place to prevent any similar events from occurring in the future."

## Actions

This a great example of lessons learned. Even though the breach had nothing to do with MoonPig’s data security, it proactively voiced concerns.  The breach was likely down to customers using the same login details across multiple websites. One of these sites had been breached and the attackers then had everything they needed to access accounts all over the web.
MoonPig learned from its January 2015 shaming, and when the threat of a compromise was discovered, they reacted immediately to contain the security breach.  Given that only 7 months separated the two incidents, MoonPig risked additional damage to its reputation.

## Moving forward

It is crucial to the PhotoBox group that everyone plays their part in safeguarding the security of its customers and systems. With the upcoming changes to General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), the onus is on every employee (permanent, part-time, temporary, freelance) to report and question anything that they feel could be a risk to the safety of data held by PhotoBox Group.
The repercussions for any breach or violation could equate to €20 million or 4% of the entity’s global gross revenue (whichever is greater). We are all responsible for reporting and signposting potential risks and everyone should feel happy to do so without fear.

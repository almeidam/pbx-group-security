## Why we started this blog

One of the biggest challenges in any company, is how best to communicate with staff in a way that really keeps them informed of what's going on. What is very interesting in the Photobox Group is the remarkable lack of politics within the company. This is quite rare. The politics, the games, and the attrition that occurs because of company politics, seems to be absent from the company and the group security team.

What we do have - a common problem among larger organisations - is the occasional inefficiency in communication. This is caused by many factors; culture, technology, procedures, or a lack of time to properly disseminate information. In a way, if people don't know what's happening, it's not because of a conscious decision not to share information, it's because the infrastructure isn't there to share it. 

This blog, this website, and the data on it, are the building blocks for that infrastructure. The security and technology staff in the Photobox Group will be the builders. Here you will see the entire security team talking about what they do and how they do it; their successes and frustrations, their challenges, their problems, and their achievements. 

One of the things I've learned is that sometimes it is easier to collaborate internally, by applying external channels. Which is to say, you can collaborate with your team by speaking in an open and distributed way on an external forum. This means that information reaches its target more easily. Where you lose in terms of control over who accesses the information, you gain by accessing many more people than would otherwise be possible, both within and outside your team. Another benefit is the focus on tone; you hone a more effective voice that influences your reach and improves communication. This mirrors the benefits of Open Sourcing, which promotes a deeper level of collaboration within the same company. It's only when you open source a particular piece of code that you see the level of internal collaboration skyrocketing across a company. 

Every member of the Photobox Group security team will write blog posts about what they do, and post them here. This blog will be where we communicate. Another great advantage of this blog is that it will allow us to reach a much wider community and collaborate. If there's a problem and we share it here, we hope to access a much wider network of expertise and advice than is available in-house. If we're struggling with a Kanban dashboard for example, we will post the issues in a blog and hope that someone in our wider network will contribute with some useful advice in the form of comments.

We are also hoping the blog will help convince people to come and work with us by demonstrating how open we are in a visible and meaningful way. Anyone can say: _"we are open"_, but until we start sharing more information in a public forum such as this blog, we are not. Once we regularly post our thoughts here, people will see our openness in action. The Photobox Group empowers and allows the team to do this, and we hope you will think, "That's the company I want to work for".

## Press Releases for Project Briefs
At PhotoBox Group Security, we are in the process of adopting the Amazon press release model, which is an interesting way to map projects. We have already used the press release model for a few big projects, which is the traditional application of the concept.  However, our team also hopes to use the process for much smaller projects.

### Flexible FAQs
The key elements that I like about the press release concept are the front page containing all the key information, which is then followed by an FAQ. The FAQs are interesting because they provide a lot of flexibility; they allow you to target specific audiences or areas that you want to cover, or even specific aspects of the projects. FAQs can evolve as the project evolves, from the planning phase, to execution, to completion. We use JIRA to store all this data and provide version control. 

### Consider the audience
The "press release", or front page provides the vision, where you can say, "This is what success looks like". It is, of course, vital to consider the audience. Is this a press release for an internal team, or for customers?

When you get the press release right it can be powerful. It also scales well, a press release for a very small project may provide one or two paragraphs, or you can have five. This makes the process of joining or contributing to a project much easier for stakeholders, who can get instant access (from the project managers) to disparate sources of information and help, "how tos", examples, and templates. 

### Learning process
This change will involve a teething process, and the project team may need assistance for the first five or ten versions of this. Once they are familiar with the process, implementing this for the next projects will be easier, because they already have a good set of examples. The recommendation for getting started is to take several projects that are already running. 

Recall the philosophy that everything that everybody is doing, is a project <!--- link to everything is a project article---> ? Every project has: a budget, a team, resources, and information. So, we are ready to on-board those projects that already exist, allowing us to go very quickly to the meat of the matter, which is writing those press releases so they are read and understood. 

### Represent reality
The challenge to the team is to represent the reality of the situation. They don't have to worry, "Is this going to be approved or not?"  Those initial set-up projects are already approved, the resources already allocated.

The first major milestone is to reach a point of balance, where we have press releases created in a realistic, workable, and usable way that represent every single current project. Yes, the number of press releases will be large, because there is a lot going on. However, there is a vital component to managing all this.

### Simplify the exercise
We must ensure that the project management team doesn't overload the other teams implementing this process. They must find solutions to simplify the exercise. One strategy is to interview the teams and ask them to describe what they do. Then the project management team can take that information, create a press release, map it out, and ask, "Did we capture everything?" It is easier to get buy-in when you start by asking, "What are you doing?", or, "How does it work?" Then, the project team can observe, and if buy-in does not progress they can sit with the team and ask, "What are you doing?". They observe, and then reverse-engineer the press release and the FAQ, based on what is happening at that moment.

### Measures of Success
The good news is that you don't have to invent too much. There is no complex approval process and implementation is already underway. We will know that we have reached the first milestone when anyone can describe the current projects within the Photobox Group Security team based on the press releases for those projects. The same will apply for all the stakeholders, including the key persons who are accountable, and at executive level we can assess and review everything with ease by referring to the press releases. Rather than such meetings asking for further information, we will be able to answer all questions, address all queries, and then you can just get on with the project.

So, that's the philosophy behind our implementation of the press release concept from Amazon, which is a really cool idea.

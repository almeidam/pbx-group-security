I just read Elon Musk's biography, which I highly recommend. One of the interesting takeaways for me, which I did not know before reading, was that Musk is an excellent programmer and designer. It is evident throughout the book as he reveals his history. Musk came from a programing background -- he loved to code. 

Instinctively, he knew how to write code at a deep level beginning in his childhood. From the way he speaks and works, it is evident he thinks like a programmer. He breaks problems into logical chunks. He finds out what it will take to solve those problems. Then, he breaks them down further into small bits and executes them one at the time.

I also think that he is very good at understanding the compound effect of programming, or problem solving. By that I mean that you may start with 10 problems but, in fact, the 7th or 8th problem can often be addressed by something that you used to solve the first couple of problems. It's not unlike the microchip designer scenario, where they know that the next version of a microchip will be designed based on the version they are working on at that moment. You benefit from scale. That philosophy is revealed in how Musk thinks and operates.

Musk's other big strength is design. His approach is to design the experience, not just the looks, which are, of course, also very important. He deliberates the function with a great level of understanding about how things work. If you examine Musk and how his companies operate, you see that he doesn’t just build a device, he designs the factory to build the device. This is very important, because ultimately, it's the machine that builds the machine. 

This idea reminds me of something I saw recently in an article about Amazon:  the concept of creating environments where you can iterate very quickly in specific areas and, of course, self-contain wisely. 

The final philosophy that Musk adopted from programming, which is also referred to as "agile" in the web world, is the whole "integrate fast" concept. This idea is dependent on learning, then integrating that knowledge, and then learning again. Just look at the technological innovation coming from the companies he leads, for example, Tesla and SpaceX. Their success is based on the fact that they learn so fast. They use software in a way that outstrips the attempts by other companies. For example, Tesla cars auto-update themselves. So do their satellites. They keep pushing. Deploying fast has become second nature to Musk's companies, and they are doing it at the hardware, and power tools levels, as well.

So, programming skills, deep design, and integrate fast are the three key factors that, I believe, have contributed to Musk’s success. Not to dismiss his incredible drive, and the fact that he leads by example and works crazy hours. And about those crazy hours: Personally, I think that there must be balance in all aspects of our lives. But Musk thinks about that, too. He is very focused on the environment that people work in. The environment matters. If you can create the time and space where people can get into the zone and be happily productive, this impacts how effective a company can be. 

I think our challenge is to implement these same skills. We also want to create environments where people enjoy performing and are part of a high-performing team. We must nurture fluidity, where everything flows and everybody is moving in the same direction. The challenge, of course, is how to do that, right? This is what we are motivated to create here. At group security, we aim to be one of those highly effective teams -- a team that can make a difference.

So, yes, it is very inspiring and interesting to get insights into how Musk thinks, and to see how the quality and updatability of his products, the design and the energy, are creating outcomes that are literally changing the world.

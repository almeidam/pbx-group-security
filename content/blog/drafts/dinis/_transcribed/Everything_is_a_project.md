Everything is a project

One of the key philosophies that we hold at group security is, that everything we do is a project. Consider when you are carrying out: a backup, or doctrace deployment, a firewall review, or even a pentest; you can think of each as a project. Let's extend that to, for example: network support, its initial response is a project; where technical writing and maintaining Jira and compliance are projects; where admin functions or even execs creations, or 
senior level management parts, 
are all projects. 

The benefit of this approach is it provides us with a standardize way to map our environment. This approach applies from: planning, to execution, to completion; through the budget and resource allocation. So, once you take this project-centric view to
these buckets you can use to map things to, 
you realize that what we really have is a project. If it has a brief, a set of objectives that have very clear deliverables, then call this a project. You can have cycling yearly projects, that get renewed every year, which lend themselves to adjustments and consequently to measures of success. You can have OKR's, you can have KPI's, you can have budget requirements. And you also have things like resources, and the resources are: people, tools, services and other teams that you have to interact with, indeed anything that is required for the particular project to succeed.

We are nurturing this environment, making this part of the daily activities. We have instigated a team to manage the whole process and to improve automation; so hopefully, eventually, by using a Jira-based workflow, we will get the whole process to an automated state where it just happens adding value to everybody.

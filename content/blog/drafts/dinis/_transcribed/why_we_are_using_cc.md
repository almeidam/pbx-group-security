Why we are realizing content and then creative comments


The license that we use on the PBX Group Security website from all the content is creative comments. The license that we are using for code is a patch it to. The reason why we apply the licenses is because we want to send a very strong message, that this is information, and this is something for, not just Photobox, but also group security, but also for everybody at Photobox, all the teams, all the brands, but also everybody from the wider community. And the power of applying one of these licenses is that, that's the message you send. It's a power that say, when you contribute, or when you use this, you will not be locked in that environment.

What this allows, is that it allows a much more empowering, and in a way, open and collaboration environment, because the people that want to contribute, now that: 

a) the contributions will continue to be open in the future, 
b) they can gladly take it and use it

So, I already had a number of people that reach out and said, how they like the idea, and how they would like to use internally. And, if you don't apply one of those licenses, that question becomes very complex, very soon. Where once you release in the creative comments license immediately, the other entities can start to think about how they can use? Where they can use it? How they can customize it? How they can make it better? How they can fork it and make their own? 

And that's how collaboration occurs. So, that's is fundamentally why we are releasing all the content here under creative content. And that, the kind of hope, is that some of the best challenges, and some of the best content will actually be provided by subject matter experts and by people from the community that are able to provide really good insides for questions, and really good ideas how to best in this field, and allow candidates to show it in the interview process.

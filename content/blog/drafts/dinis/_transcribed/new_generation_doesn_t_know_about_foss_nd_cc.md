The next generation is not aware of open source and creative comments

Tonight, while having dinner with some friends, I met a nineteen-year-old who is studying Politics at university. I was shock to discover that he has no concept of open source and creative commons copyright licenses. As someone who has watched these concepts emerge, grow and establish themselves this is quite fascinating.

These ideas have shaped our world. To my generation they were radical concepts: you were called a communist; told: "that will never work"; or: "that's crazy"; or "there will be no financial model". Now, as you know, some of the biggest companies in the world, develop on top of open source, creative commons. From giants such as Wikipedia to the Noun project; there is simly tons of tons of open source stuff. Without a doubt, it has proved its value: commercially, ethically, morally, and practically. How has this not permeated through to someone at university level? I would expect universities to be the champions of the open source environment. 

It is a tragedy that this generation has not been exposed to the philosophy behind this. It should not be that each generation has to walk the same path as the previous, they should be able to take advantage of the progress made. It's not easy to think in open way. It's not easy to collaborate, or to write under those license constraints. People need to have a good understanding an routing in the philophy and business implications to do so. This generation is definitely missing a trick by not exploring and understanding this. In terms of competitive advantage they are losing out. 

Your time at university should be an era of great creativity, when you are pushing stuff out. You should be exploring and developing your ideas. University provides the opportunity to connect the world, this is where you start to create relationships that in the future might land you some really interesting opportunities or jobs, or personal connections. It seems a perfect time to be exploring this 
                graph-like 
world of publishing things, learning how to write things, learning how to get the heads around, actually publishing, for example, even creating a book, is something that is a really missed opportunity.

One of my comments to the nineteen-year-old that I was speaking to was saying "Look, if you can get your head around and publish on platforms such as Medium, for example. Link your articles to public locations, maybe even publish a book, even get it printed out in Amazon, you'd get a job!". Doing that is still impressive, because not that many people, actually, have been able to do that, or have the confidence to try that. 

My advice is write and write, because that's how, actually, you start to fine-tune your ideas. The key to success is that you have to write a lot. It's not about writing one respected book, post one spectacular idea, and that wins the world's attention. It's about  constant publishing that allows you to become that "overnight success" after 100 blog posts, right? So, basically, that's why is so important to publish and to write, and to learn about your inner voice, and to write about things that you care about. 

So, my recommendation to him, was that he should write about the things that he is passionate about. From the work that he does at the university, to the great movie, documentary, article he read. He should write his ideas down and publish them, and then send those links to his friends and the people he knows, and comment on others that are doing some of those things, and that's basically how he builds his brand. So, it's very fundamental he starts to build the brand and also to capture those ideas to shape his future self.

So, the important thing, is that even is if only one person reads that Medium post, in a couple of years from now, that will be worth something in the future. Because I guarantee that in a couple of years from now, he is going to read the stuff that he wrote and go, "wow, that is really cool. That is a really good idea". And if he hadn't captured that idea on hyperlink, backed up on Medium it will disappear, and that idea, that little nugget of something that could become spectacular, is lost forever.

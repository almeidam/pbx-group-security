Problem Transfer:  Don't Give Others Your Problem

One of the greatest statements that resonated with me at a Photobox leadership meeting was this: "Don't give others your problems."  The term "others" refers to clients, customers, team members, and other divisions of the company. If you are working on specific tasks with deadlines, it can be very easy to transfer your to-do list to others. This is not a form of delegation but rather a problem that you could have solved yourself. Theoretically, it places a tax onto someone else's work load.  

We can look at a typical project management situation for an example of how you might avoid handing off your problems to others. In most project management activities, the team members work on faith-based data. So, it is necessary to have weekly or even daily briefing meetings to bring everyone up to speed on the progress of the activities. Your job as the lead is to present any problems and also have possible solutions to offer to the team. That way, the team can see that you have done some background work on the issue, captured the data, and presented it as "this is what is happening because this is what I am reading."

A particularly important reason not to tranfer problems to others is that it greatly slows down the completion process of the team. It is easy to ask team members "what is happening" when looking at data, but it is the actually the easy way out. It becomes a very complicated question for others to digest when they may not have the same mental picture you have when viewing the situation. It may take a lot of time to bring the team up to speed on the understanding of the issue. It is almost like two negatives occurring at the same time. So, the key here is to always look for solutions that make tackling the project fluid, provide your team with what they need to get things done, and let your team know how much you are asking them to complete.

At the company level, it makes excellent business sense to look after your own problems, that is to handle project tasks in-house. A great benefit to centralizing the work within the team or company is that gives everyone a sense of pride when they can say "we do that here in our own company." It is also usually more productive, because you can get more resources, more talent, more people, and more capabilities from within. Working in-house allows you, as a project is mapped out, to be able see the connections between the different elements, the connections between the different objectives, the different bids and who is delegating and who is working hard. If you look at project management, one of the hardest parts is not always about knowing what is going on, as I stated above, but also being able to assign tasks correctly, finding great solutions to get information or material, having a good team, and always providing the capabilities to perform. We are like the Boy Scouts, we always leave the campsite better than we found it. We should be striving to positively impact our team, our company, and our customers on a daily basis with better business interactions.

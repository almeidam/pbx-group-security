Using Git as a back-up strategy

One of the important properties that version control systems have is that they version your code, obviously. And that actually means that they are a very powerful way to back-up your data, as you do work allowing you to do back in time. So, in a way, version control systems like Git, they are fundamentally back-up systems and time-machines. Because the problem I see often is that it works that only exists in one machine, and work that only exists in one machine, that is a disaster waiting to happen. 

The other problem is that is that machine is compromised or infected, you have a bigger problem, which is a fact that if you want to go back in time, or if you want to go to a version or if you want to go back in a tangent of your development work, you can't, because controls like that, only takes you so far.

So, the key concept here, is that everything you do, every asset, every possible information that you create is stored in a system somewhere, and that can either be Git, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, anyway. What you don't want is something that is stored locally. 

Usually, when you learn in researching, there is a tendency to say, it's not good enough, or it's not ready, I won't publish it. But, that creates a problem, because what you actually have in a information that is not shared, or knowledge that it not shared, and you don't allow others to help you, which is a fault. Because you don't do anything else.

The key is to view Git as a back-up system, and to make sure that everything you do ends up there. And that means that every day and every hour, at least every day, you should commit the stuff you've done, which is also a great way to test it and check it, to clean up a little bit. And that's really how you share knowledge.

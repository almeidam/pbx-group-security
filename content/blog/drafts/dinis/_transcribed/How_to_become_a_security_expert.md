##How to become a security expert

The best way to really get your head around security is to exploit security vulnerabilities. I encourage this in a professional context. It is important that all developers have a good understanding of the technology, especially those that are moving into the security space. We have a number of people in our team who fit this criteria. And our job is to take these professionals to the next level. 

This means getting hands-on experience. The first step is to find the vulnerabilities, then write the exploits for them, then you really understand the variation of the exploits. Next, you try to fix them. This workflow will walk you through a lot of paradigm shifts that you need to do. So, by the end, you'll understand the issues that surround data: like data validation, or data handling, or the problems with data injections. You'll understand the problems with authentication authorization. You'll understand the problems of trusting who has data, and analyse who is making decisions. You'll understand the issues around encryption and protecting data, and the value of assets. You'll understand risk conditions. You'll also understand the human element and the workflows, and the development, and the use of the pipeline. This exposure should open your mind to the complexities of our security challenges. 

So, how do you do it? We provide a number of tools, and techniques, and environments, for growth to happen. The first one, I'd say is books. I think books are a great way to learn. We probably get any books that the team wants, so our library is already quite extensive, and we'll gladly add to it. Because books are basically masterclasses, so, subject master experts, right? So, that's where you should really start to that. And books are the best technology to learn, due to its undivided focus and ability to explain the information.

Now, the next thing, you do hands on exercises. So, we use Avatron which is a Hackathon platform, which we have available for everybody. We have a couple of career paths that include using that. Avatron is excellent for providing hands on experience of the vulnerabilities. And the Hackathon challenges can be quite tricky. It's a great learning experience. Focus on doing the exercise, rather than viewing the solution, because as you attempt the exercises and understand them they provide of those vital a-ha moments. Expect a lot of paradigm shifts.

The next phase is to write the exploit. So, that's when you start to code and write the exploits yourselves. These exploits are actually tests, in a way, they are a security test. Once you can do that, you have a way to replicate the findings. It gets really interesting when you write the exploits in a testing framework because it allows you 
to look at the ability. Which gets very powerful, when you actually go and fix stuff.

Another good exercise is to take some applications, like for example, the Juice Shop or other vulnerable-by-design applications, first exploit them, and then write fixes for them. This is incredibly powerful, because it allows you to understand that actually fixing things and creating security protectors is, actually, much harder than exploiting the vulnerabilities.

I firmly believe that unless you start by the breaking the site, you struggle. Because you don't know what to test, or even you don't have that instinct to know "Hm... Iâ€™m not sure I have enough coverage". Because you know the gaps of your understanding. So, that how you do it. So, the faster you do that loop, the more quickly you become a security professional, and the more you start to understand what it takes to actually do an application in network security. 

One more thing and also important. A part of your learning curve is to ask questions, find people that you respect or you like, and ask. Every good security professional I know loves to teach, they were in that learning curve once too. So, don't feel afraid to ask questions. And finally, present. The best way to learn is to teach. So, the final phase of learning is present and produce materials that your peers respect. In a way, that is the highest form of compliment.  

So, that's basically what we really want from you, our developing professional, to get to a point where you are actually presenting your research. The ultimate goal is to create something, that peers or people that you respect, also respect. In fact it is often the best job interview ever, when you actually are presenting or you get to talk about something that you have presented or you've done, right?

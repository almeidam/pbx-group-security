title  : My dream Head of Application Security

I'm the CISO of the Photobox Group and we are currently hiring for a Head of Application Security to join our amazing team. Please share this post and JD with your network and with who you think would be a great match for our project and culture. Altough we will always make a choise based on talent and fit, I would love to get more candidates from diverse backgrounds,  namely women. 

But first of all, a bit of context about how I think about App Sec…

Basically, any company today is driven by the quality of the applications it creates. That’s because the value a company provides its customers is only as good as the technology that's created by the applications that runs on top whatever infrastructure is in place.

Yes, as we move more to an AWS world, some compounds are becoming thinner. But still, the thing that makes the difference is the application that we write - and we have to make sure those application are secure. That’s because those applications (and the code that runs on them) have full, or very privileged, access to a lot of our assets. For us at Photobox Group, that means the photos our customers store with us, their data, and some cases the personal data of our employees. That means it's critical we create an environment where writing secure code is easy, and almost automatic.

So, the vision is this: **We need to create an environment where developers can code in the most efficient, fast, and powerful way to develop apps that are secure.** 

The ‘how we do that’ is:

1. having the right mix of frameworks , which are secure by default
2. by having technology that can understand and tell us about the side effects of what we create
3. by sharing guidance that allows learning to occur, and by the right feedback loops, (either in prod or test environments) about what developers have built

All this gives us an environment that protect the assets and the application in run time, and massive the visualization and login. That allows the understanding of what is happening and when things go wrong. And that's the position we are looking to create.

**OK, so who do we need to help us achieve this?**

The person that we want is somebody that will thrive on this challenge; who basically wants to figure out, implement, and make sure we have solutions that scale for application security. The reality is that we already know a lot about writing secure code and writing secure applications at Photobox. We’ve also put a lot of work into creating environments where applications can be executed securely. And there is a whole range of technologies that can facilitate the next stage of our journey. 
The question is scalability. The question is how we do this in a way that doesn't require a huge amount of security touch points, which turn security into a bottle neck.

For example, even if we could review all the code line by line, and had all the time in the world to make changes, that model just wouldn't scale. With hundreds of developers, you’d need dozens or hundreds of security consultants. That means the only way this scales is if we can automate the knowledge and the workflows that are available to our security team - and do that in a way that our developers have access to every day.

This is even more important because of the world we’re heading into; the world of very fast development and deployments, where you post to production 5, 10, 20 times, 100 times, 1000s of times a day. 

It’s a crazy idea that as we move into this mode of fast deployment, suddenly 'we can't do security’; 'we can’t do threat models’; 'we can't do security standards’; and we can’t have all these practices that add a lot of value - to the business, not just to the security team. But the reality is that to do that, we need to be a lot more efficient. The problem we have is that in the past,  application security has not focused on scalability. And, for a whole bunch of historical reasons, app sec has not been caught up in the whole cycle of application development. 

As a result, what we need is really innovative solutions and ideas. We also needs to know works really well already, so that we can focus on allowing the company to accelerate as fast as it can, in a secure way. And by ‘secure', I mean that the risk implications of what we are putting into production (which includes dimensions about the impacts threats can have, compliance, etc) are understood by, and meet the risk appetites of, the business.

So, this is the person that we want. Somebody that looks at all this, and says “This is really exciting!” Because one of the great things about Photobox Group is that we're actually in the position where our business is investing and supports this kind of activity. They wants this from us. And that means we are accountable to ensure we do business and deliver this. That is our job, in Group Security: to find technical innovative human processes and solutions for this problem. The dev teams, and the devops teams, and techops; they all support and want this as well. So, it's now up to us to play. It's in our hands to make this happen. And that's very exciting.

These days 'the application' is actually a whole system. When you look at testing, you basically need to test the whole system. You need to test out scaling. You need to test in production. You need to be able to view the application itself, everything that is required to run the app, (from infrastructure to code, which is itself an application that also needs to be tested) - and you need to know what the state of this is.

What all this adds up to is that doing app sec means you have to be fully hands on. You need to be able to walk in in the morning and encourage developers, spend time with people really helping them to map out what is going on, helping to fix issues, helping write full requests, proposals, and being the voice of knowledge in terms of what need to be done. The you need to follow up over before lunch with architecture to help design new systems, and solutions that are secure by design. And then you need to be able to do presentations to senior management about how application security fits and can be delegated to teams. As well as commanding a useful amount of mindshare from the network of security champions that we’ve built and continue to work with, who are our bridge between 'security' and the actual development processes and teams building apps. 

This means very strong leadership, a very strong ability to deal with pressure and the ability to delegate and communicate the ideas to a much wider team and players. And it also means being willing to learn with the rest of the security team, knowing that no one has all the answers to this, but that we’ll get to the right answer together. So if you’d like to come work and collaborate with us on this journey, get in touch!

Using freelancers for small tasks.

One of the practices that we have initiated effectively here, at group security is the use of the freelancer hired for very specific tasks. We have entered the gig economy, we take advantage of the fact that there's a huge amount of spectacular talent out there that is only available if they can work on their terms, on their timing, when they are available. We've successfully created an environment to nurture this. The platform we chose is Upwork, where we have negotiated an hourly rate, and assigned hours to each individual that we wish to use on particular projects.

Now, the interesting thing about this, is that the outcome depends on the individual freelancer. It really depends on each person's ability to figure out what is the right question that they can answer, and how to get on with it.

In our experience, the right individual will take a task, analyse it, think about it, ask couple questions and get on with it. Whereas the ones that don't really work out, are the ones that paralyzed by the lack of brief, and or paralyzed by the fact that sometimes the instructions are not very detailed or immediately actionable. And the irony is; that's by design. 

There is a point at which, if you create tasks that are so obvious, or so well determined, then it was probably faster for you to do the task, than to delegate it. So, what we really want is to hand out problems, to create challenges, to provide specific requests that somebody can take on, and run with. This is where we have had incredible success. We already have several amazing individuals in the team that have been able to take these tasks, run with them and produce some spectacular outcomes. 

So, if you are joining the team to do that, or if you want to join the team to do those things, come - it is going to be very interesting. You can take on some really interesting work and the idea is to leverage your professionalism, leverage your professional experience, what you are really good at, what makes you special. That's what we really want to nurture. Because, fundamentally, if you love what you do, you are going to do it much better, with care and attention to detail, which is what we are after. And, it works really well. So remember, if you are joining the team, your job is to find your spot. We will deliberately give you a wide range of tasks to select from. Don't worry if the first tasks we assign you are not the best fit, take a look around and see what is. The team is very empowering, and they are genuinely happy to help, and you should leverage our resource.

We have a very high tolerance for questions. We love questions. We love when people ask stuff. And specially, when they learn. I guess what we have very low tolerance is for team members that don't learn or individual that struggle with just getting stuff done. Not everyone will be a perfect fit, some may be very good executioners, but I guess what we are really looking for is; those person that have bilateral thinking, that ability to think outside the box. We aim to allow the freelancer to play to their strengths and produce spectacular outcomes.

That's our freelance world.

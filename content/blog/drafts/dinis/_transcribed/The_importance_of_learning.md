## The Importance of Learning

One of the most important things for all of us to remember is this: Never stop learning. Each member of the team must find ways to incorporate learning into their day-to-day activities. If you are not learning, you are not improving as an individual, as a person, as a colleague, or as a professional. The key is to align your learning with what you need to do professionally, and what the team requires from you. That challenge, in a way, is the most interesting part of your work. 

### Accept uncertainty
The hard part of the journey is to be able to live with the uncertainties of learning. When you set off on an accelerating learning path you tend to respond to tensions. It is sometimes very hard to have the confidence to stay on the path, especially when you don't understand the contingencies. You try something and that leads you to something else. So, you do that, and that leads to something else. And all these tensions keep revealing themselves. 

The reality is that these tensions can point you in the right direction. A difficult challenge is to accept that this is okay. Typically, a problem that you tried to solve early in a process will probably only be solved by something you do at a later stage. Of course, you can't deviate from the original path too much. The key is knowing where to stop -- knowing when following that tension is not going to work. Having said that, it is important to keep in mind that failure is part of the journey. If you don't fall over occasionally then you just aren't trying. The person that never makes a mistake never makes anything, right? 

Another major challenge in learning is having the confidence to believe that it will work out in the end. Sometimes you have to be a little bit naive. You have to be a little bit blind to the enormity of what you are undertaking. If you can't do that you may never start in the first place. In a way, having a certain level of irrationality is actually very important, because that's what allows you to begin the journey.

### Take ownership of your work
The philosophy of our team is that everybody should be a leader. Everybody must take ownership of their actions, ownership of their areas. You do that both by being good at what you do and by accepting that you need to learn a lot. Understand that you are always traveling along this big learning curve, which is what we encourage every team member to do. We work in a highly technical field, and it's important to fully understand the media that we are dealing with. You are part of a technical team, which means that you need to have a wide range of knowledge -- because that's what gives you the required grounding -- and be able to clearly understand what is possible and what is not. Not only that, we all need to continue to learn about the business.

### Learn how you learn!

Maintaining the drive to learn is fundamental to your continued development. One of my personal challenges is to make sure that I continue to learn. Remember that learning is a game: there is a technique to it, there are ways to do it well. There are ways to be more efficient. Everybody's personal journey should include coming to an awareness of learning how they learn best, and finding the techniques that are the most effective for them. Some people work best at home, some people from a caf√©, some in an office. Different types of learning may suit quiet environments, some may favor a busy power environment. 

Aim to learn something new every week. Develop your personal plan. Think about what you want to learn next and align that with the activities that we are doing in the group security. The good news is, there are so many areas and so much space in group security that it's actually up to the individual to identify the most important challenges and conquer them. That is why we provide the space for that to happen, because we trust you to become what we need you to be.

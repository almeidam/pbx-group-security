My dream Head of Risking Compliance profile. 

So now, in the mix of recruitment process with several candidates coming through the pipeline. I'd like to share some of my thoughts on what would be, for me, the ideal Head of RC.

The candidate must have a really clear vision of how risk of compliance can enable the business, an understanding that this can make the business grow faster. Risk compliance simplifies processes, managing risks and being compliant is, at its core, an operational practice. It's the ability to execute a number of rules, related to regulations, very effectively and very professionally.
 
I'm a big believer of a strong approach machine, that is, an efficient, process driven workflow. Fundamentally, risk management is the ability to understand the implications of the decisions that are being made, to facilitate the business owners of the assets that we are talking about, to make informed decisions.

In essence the challenge is about data: being able to collect the right amount of data, filter and analyse  it, and present it in ways that can be easily consumed. Whether that be in text, graphs, infographics, etc. Risk management encompasses the workflow that allows that to occur. That workflow must allow the risk decisions to match the risk strategy of the company. And that's something that need to be executed from the lowest level of the organization all the way to the top. From individual on the ground, to the C-level executives, all the way to the board. The board is the ultimate risk arbitrator of this entire process. 

Traditionally risk-management translates to risk-aversion, because teams are allergic to it; nobody wants to own risk, and nobody wants to embrace it head on. Typically, it becomes a bureaucratic exercise. Which results in it being driven, by a perception of the reality, rather than the reality itself. Risk management teams tend to operate independently and consequently they tend to live on a separate reality, because they don't tap real data. Real data, should feed in real time, driven by the actual operational components from where that data is created. This should then feed a whole number of dashboards analytics, enabling teams to make good decisions.

What we need to do, from a group security point of view, is make this process smooth. We must create an environment where data empowers our teams, so that they can move faster, because they know the rules of the game. They know how to get things done. They know the processes to go through and they allow, in a meaningful way, the systems to work without group-secure intervention. That's what we want to create. We must provide a workflow where somebody wants to do something, but the rules of engagement are hard to find, so they create a risk ticket, this is documented and directed to the right person for risk acceptance, then group security approves. The techops, for example, can implements this and facilitate a smooth process. In our case is going to be powered by a bunch of scripts, but it's the implementation that needs to be efficient. 

The compliance aspect is simply the ability to map the current rules and regulation that we have to review, from a policy view point. The big core is GPR but we also have to be PCA compliant. Those GPR represent a competitive advantage, we get this right and we'll be better than our competitors. We will be able to demonstrate that we care about data and our customers' magic moments and be able streamline many process. Because, often the reason why compliance is hard, is because we are looking for inefficiencies within the system. We are basically looking at parts of the business that didn't possess the required maturity, or care, or focus. Sometimes, it's not that the team doesn't want to do something, is just they were not assigned that responsibility, or it was not part of the business requirement.

I like the GPR. It puts customer data, and the care of customer data, at the heart of what companies need to do. Companies can either perceive this as a massive compliance problem, a drag on the business, or they can use it as an accelerator. Sticking to the car analogy, there are many security features in cars, like brakes for example, which ultimately make it safer for the car to go faster. That's what we want. We want the GPR to be a feature that actually drives the business to go faster. Let it make us integrate better with third parties, and allow us to be much more efficient in how we create new projects. Use it as the stimulus to share data more effectively and more efficiently, internally and externally. And to do that in more secure way. We can use it to help stimulate us to perform better.

Ultimately, it will allow us to plan for failure in a much more efficient way, because we know there'll be issues, the question is how we handle and how we process those issues. So, for me, the Head of Risking Compliance is somebody that will thrive on this challenge, and who has the technical background to grasp all the implications. Our candidate needs to be able to communicate at the engineer level, and be persuasive and drive their point across.

My perfect candidate has programming experience and knows how to program. This could be python, it could be VBA for Excel, of course, JavaScript or Scala, would be more interesting. But, when somebody knows the basics of programming, it means they are free from the constructs that surround the data. They are able to look examine a data output and say; "I can automate this" or "we can program that so that I can visualize this". This is why a programming background makes all the difference. A programmer must have the ability to take a very complex problem and break it into small little problems, and solve them in sequence, and put them together again. This is the core of programming.

Our candidate must have excellent focus when it comes to details, process, and law. We need somebody that <!--- is this an accepted adjective?!---> geeks reading law documents. Somebody for whom the definition of a good book is it about GPR. We need someone that finds it entertaining, that actually enjoys the particularities of the law. Our candidate must want to attend meetings and participate on articles on GDPR. Ideally, they want to be an active participant in changing, and interacting with those laws. We need a geek for law, and rules in the same way that some of our members are geeks for technology and security.

That's the role and that's my ideal candidate. Our challenge now, is to create challenges that allow candidates to demonstrate these skills and this mindset. We must create a fair recruitment process that allows the perfect candidate to shine and for it to be evident why a particular individual is the right one.

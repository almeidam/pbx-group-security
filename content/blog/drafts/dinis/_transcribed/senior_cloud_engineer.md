Senior Cloud Security Engineer

Part of the team that we are recruiting is an experience Cloud Security Engineer and by that, I mean somebody that has very deep expertise on Cloud Security. If I had to pick one, I'd say AWS, although you have a lot of stuff in Azure too. But we do a have a push for AWS. 

And the reason why we basically, mapped this very senior person that is quite a good rate. It's because cloud today is as complex as an operating system, and the complexities and subtilties of the environment cannot be underestimated. So, we really need somebody that is really good with the cloud, that basically, eats it for lunch. That geeks out everything about it, that knows exactly how it works, it's been working on it for years. Basically, it's a really advanced power user that scripts everything, that is really an individual that is going to be able to take our cloud environment to the next level.

It's also important to balance security with performance, and maintainability, and deployment and resilience. I think, my instinct is that security has to be one of those areas that really pushes knowledge to the limit. So, my expectation is that the person that has huge amount of security expertise is also be somebody that has a huge amount of focus on resilience, on reliability, on infrastructure, so running survey monkey, and just trying the whole thing. And make sure that every system is able to survive by itself, and has full control of what is happening there.

The idea is that you have a server that is running, that we don't know what is, is crazy. Because, you know, forget about the cost issues. it's actually, that could be something mining bitcoins, that could be a malicious server running. We need to have a full visibility of what is running in our environment. So, the idea that the system in unauthenticated, or don't authorize each other, or make connections that without us understanding, in a way, from a security point of view, just crazy. And that's how it should be. We should have zero tolerance for not understanding what is happening at cloud environment. And with the rate of innovation and what is going on, it's getting more and more complex to do this. So, we need somebody that can really understand at the very deep level what is actually going on.

So, Photobox group security provides a spectacular opportunity for someone like this, because really, the tech team wants to be involved, the tech team is asking from an involvement. The tech team really driving hardware where is possible, and to with a cloud environment. And of course, that the next part is also using machine learning and artificial intelligence for security, which gets very exciting. We actually should be using the actual of AWS, the power of Azure, to actually helps us in security to understand what is going on, understand our practices, make sure that we have a group bust and resilience very effective environment to perform our duties as guardian of the data and the assets that we have there. 

Not only, this is going to be a very exciting project to work, to actually protect and help the actual business. It's also a spectacular work to be used on how we consumers of those technologies, as we ourselves are moving into cloud, and our activities and understanding to scale. Somebody gives a pile of logs, we should be able to look them in the face and go cool, and I can analyze that. If somebody wants to gives us a massive amount of strings of data, we should be able to do it, because we should be able to have the capabilities and the technology, and the workflows, to be able to consume that amount of information.

So, that's my ideal person, somebody that really geeks out the cloud, and really want to take it to the next level at an environment where that is embrace, encourage and celebrate.

## Senior Cloud Security Engineer

Part of the team that we are recruiting is an experienced Cloud Security Engineer and by that, I mean somebody that has very deep expertise on Cloud Security. If I had to pick one, I'd say AWS, although you have a lot of stuff in Azure too. But we do a have a push for AWS. 

And the reason why we created a role for a senior candidate is because cloud, today, is as complex as an operating system, and the complexities and subtilties of the environment cannot be underestimated. We need somebody eats could for lunch, that <!--- is this an accepted term?---> geeks out everything about it, that knows exactly how it works, who has been working on it for years. We need that advanced power user that scripts everything. We need to assign someone that is going to be able to take our cloud environment to the next level.

Our candidate must be able to balance security with performance, maintainability, deployment and resilience. My instinct is that security has to be one of those areas that really pushes knowledge to the limit. My expectation is that the right person must have huge amount of security expertise as well as the ability to focus on resilience, on reliability, on infrastructure. They must work with data, and run survey monkey to test ideas. They must ensure that every system is able to survive by itself, and has full control of what is happening in all systems.

The issue with cloud is that it is like have a server that is running, that you don't know what is, is crazy. It doesn't matter that this server is generating income, it could be mining bitcoins and still be a malicious server running. We need to have a full visibility of what is running in our environment. We must know when a system is unauthenticated and restrict authorization. We must ensure we do not make connections that we don't understand from a security point of view. Our reality must be a zero tolerance for not understanding what is happening in the cloud environment. With the rate of innovation and what is going on, the complexity and therefore the challenge, grows. We need somebody that can really understand at the very deep level what is going on.

Photobox group security provides a spectacular opportunity for someone like this, because really, the tech team wants to be involved. The tech team are already driving hardware, where possible, and too the cloud environment. Our next phase will be to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence for security, which gets very exciting. We need to be using AWS and the power of Azure, to help us understand what is going on in security. We need to fully understand our practices, make sure that we have a group <!--- please clarify---> bust and a resilient and effective environment to perform our duties as guardian of the data and the assets that we manage. 

My ideal candidate, therefore, is one who geeks out on cloud, and is ready to take it to the next level in an environment where that is embraced, encouraged and celebrated.

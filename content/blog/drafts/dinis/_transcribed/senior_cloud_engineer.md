## Senior Cloud Security Engineer

One role we are recruiting for is an experienced Cloud Security Engineer and I mean somebody who has great expertise in Cloud Security. If I had to pick one, I'd say AWS, although there is a lot of stuff in Azure too. But we do have a push for AWS. 

The reason we created a role for a senior candidate is because Cloud, today, is as complex as an operating system, and the complexities and subtleties of the environment cannot be underestimated. We need someone who eats cloud for lunch, who 'geeks out' on everything about Cloud, who knows exactly how it works, and who has been working on it for years. We need an advanced power user who scripts everything. We need someone who will take our Cloud environment to the next level.

### Candidate qualities

Our candidate must be able to balance security with performance, maintainability, deployment, and resilience. My instinct tells me that security must be one of those areas that really pushes knowledge to the limit. My expectation is that the right person will have a huge amount of security expertise as well as the ability to focus on resilience, on reliability, and on infrastructure. They must work with data, and run Survey Monkey to test ideas. They must ensure that every system is able to survive by itself, and has full control of what is happening in all systems.

### Issues with Cloud

The issue with Cloud is that you can have a server that is running, but you don't know what the server is. This is crazy. It doesn't matter if the server is generating income, it could be mining bitcoins and still be a malicious server. We need to have full visibility of what is running in our environment. We must know when a system is unauthenticated and restrict authorization. We must ensure we do not make connections that we don't understand from a security point of view. We must show zero tolerance for not understanding what is happening in the Cloud environment. The complexities and the challenges of the Cloud grow in tandem with the astonishing rate of innovation. Our team needs somebody who can really understand at a very deep level what is going on.

### Exciting Opportunities in Photobox

Photobox group security provides a spectacular opportunity for someone like this, because the tech team wants to be involved. The tech team is already driving hardware where possible. Our next phase will apply Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for security, which is very exciting. We need to use AWS and the power of Azure, to help us understand what is going on in security. We need to fully understand our practices, make sure that we have a resilient and effective environment in which to perform our duties as guardians of the data and the assets that we manage. 

### The Ideal Candidate

My ideal candidate, therefore, is one who geeks out on Cloud, and is ready to take it to the next level in an environment where that is embraced, encouraged, and celebrated.

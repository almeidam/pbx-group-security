Write an GDPR breach notification letter to one of the EU Regulators (for example the ICO in the UK) with a breach notification for (at least) one of the following scenarios:

 - 1024 PhotoBooks and cards sent to the wrong recipient
 - Customer's Usernames and Passwords available to download in S3 bucket (via exposed API key and Secret)
 - HR system exposed sensitive employee data to internal employees
 - Non-opted in customers received marketing communications
 - ... Another scenario that you have personal/professional experience in....

**Notes**

 - You have creative license to expand the chosen scenarios
 - You can choose an EU Regulator from one of the four companies the Photobox Group operates
   (UK, France, Spain and Germany)
 - It would be very interesting to see the same scenario sent to multiple regulators, where the
   differences between them would be highlighted

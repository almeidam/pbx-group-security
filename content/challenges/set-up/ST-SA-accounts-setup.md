In order to respond to the challenges in a scalable and collaborative way, we
ask candidates to use a Jekyll based website, which will be setup for you. We also
use Slack as a collaboration medium (which you should have received the invite link
by email)

To kick start this process you need to:

1. Create an GitHub Account (if you don't have one already)
2. Join the slack organisation
3. Contact one of the Slack admins and share you GitHub account alias

If Slack doesn't work (or you don't want to use it), just send the GitHub account alias to [project-cx@photobox.com](mailto://project-cx@photobox.com)

You are given 5 GB, 50 GB or 500 GB of nginx server logs (pick the one you are most comfortable handling). These logs cover a period over which we know a high level vulnerability was exposed.

Your job is to:

1. build an AWS-based infrastructure to consume, query, and visualise the data
2. find evidence of that vulnerability being exploited (and if so, by whom)

You can use any technology or service required.

Explain the kind of dashboard that you would create, and how you would use it to understand the vulnerability impact (or exploitation).

### How to Submit your answers

Please submit your answers using a clone [of this GitHub repository](https://github.com/photobox/pbx-candidate-answers), which is a
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based website. You can find
more detailed instructions [here](/page/submit-using-git-repo/).

**Think agile and incremental changes**

Your first priority should be to:

 - set up the website
 - make a simple change
 - send us (by email) the link to your repo (or site if you are using GitHub to host it)

**Don't wait until you have all answers to contact us!**

Part of the excercise is to see how you evolve and work collaboratively (in this case with us).
The ideal candidate will be making regular updates, asking focused questions and help to make
the challenges better.
